            <li style="color:blue;">We can also access this data from the scikit-learn library. There are 506 samples and 13 feature variables in this dataset. The objective is to predict the value of prices of the house using the given features.</li><br><hr><br>
            <li style="color:green;"> The prices of the house indicated by the variable MEDV is our target variable and the remaining are the feature variables based on which we will predict the value of a house.</li><br><hr><br>
            <li style="color:orange;">he prices increase as the value of RM increases linearly. There are few outliers and the data seems to be capped at 50. The prices tend to decrease with an increase in LSTAT. Though it doesn’t look to be following exactly a linear line.</li><br><hr><br>
